**Preface**

For this project I will be conducting a comprehensive analysis of the _Carsonella Ruddii_ bacteria.
I chose this specie because it has a small genome which I am very unfamiliar with, but is still well-characterized.

I'm excited to explore this organism and learn a variety of of new bioinformatic tools along the way.
